I am a scientific software developer. I build and teach software for data acquisition, data management, and scientific data analysis. I lead the Data Engineering Group at Brookhaven National Lab's [National Synchrotron Light Source II](https://www.bnl.gov/ps/), a Department of Energy facility that supports a broad range of scientific research.

My primary work is the [Bluesky Project](http://blueskyproject.io) (not to be confused with the social platform of the same name, which came about a decade later). Bluesky leverages the scientific Python ecosystem to enable experimental science at the lab-bench scale and facility scale.

I enjoy advocating for open source software and open science. I coauthored and maintain the [Scientific Python Development Guide](https://learn.scientific-python.org/development/) to help scientists development sustainable software tools and habits.

I live in Baltimore.
