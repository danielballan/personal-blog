I am a scientific software developer. I build and teach software for data
acquisition, data management, and scientific data analysis. I am employed at
Brookhaven National Lab's National Synchrotron Light Source II, a Department of
Energy facility that supports a broad range of scientific research.

My primary work is the [Bluesky Project](http://blueskyproject.io), which
leverages the scientific Python ecosystem to enable experimental science at the
lab-bench scale and facility scale. I also fiddle with distributed hardware
control using [caproto](https://caproto.github.io/caproto). I volunteer with the
[Environmental Data & Governance Initiative](https://envirodatagov.org/),
focusing on tracking changes to the government's environmental reporting; that
work has been
[adopted by the Internet Archive wayback machine](https://twitter.com/Mr0grog/status/1144293816729423872).
See [github.com/danielballan](https://github.com/danielballan/) for more of my
software contributions.

I enjoy advocating for open source software and open science; I maintain a
[guide](https://nsls-ii.github.io/scientific-python-cookiecutter/) to help
scientists get started with good software tools and habits.

I earned a PhD in Experimental Soft Condened Matter Physics with
[Robert Leheny](https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/directory/robert-leheny/) in
2014. My work included development of software for
[particle tracking and microrheology](https://soft-matter.github.io/trackpy/v0.4.1/)
that is still widely used. As an undergraduate, I studied music, applied math,
and physics at the University of Rochester.

I live in Baltimore with my wife and daughter. I make regular visits to
Brookhaven, located outside of New York City. I am an amateur musician, a Lindy
Hopper, and an enthusiastic Baltimorean.
