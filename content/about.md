I am a scientific software developer at a national facility that supports a
broad range of scientific research. I work at Brookhaven National Lab's
National Synchrotron Light Source II, building and teaching software for data
acquisition, data management, and scientific data analysis.

I am best known for my work on the [Bluesky Project](http://blueskyproject.io). 
I fiddle with distributed hardware control with
[caproto](https://caproto.github.io/caproto), a whimsical side project that has
grown into a useful tool. I am a happy evangelist for open source software and
open science; I maintain a
[guide](https://nsls-ii.github.io/scientific-python-cookiecutter/) to help
scientists get started with good software tools and habits.

I live in Baltimore with my wife and daughter. I make regular visits to
Brookhaven outside of New York City. I am an enthusiastic Baltimoron.
