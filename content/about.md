I am a scientific software developer, building and teaching software for data
acquisition, data management, and scientific data analysis. I am employed at
Brookhaven National Lab's National Synchrotron Light Source II, a Department of
Energy facility that supports a broad range of scientific research.

My primary work is the [Bluesky Project](http://blueskyproject.io), which
leverages the scientific Python ecosystem to enable experimental science at the
lab-bench scale and facility scale. I also fiddle with distributed hardware
control using [caproto](https://caproto.github.io/caproto). See
[github.com/danielballan](https://github.com/danielballan/) for more of my
software contributions.

I enjoy advocating for open source software and open science; I maintain a
[guide](https://nsls-ii.github.io/scientific-python-cookiecutter/) to help
scientists get started with good software tools and habits.

My background is in soft condensed matter physics. My PhD work included
development of software for
[particle tracking and microrheology](https://soft-matter.github.io/trackpy/v0.4.1/)
that is still widely used.

I live in Baltimore with my wife and daughter. I make regular visits to
Brookhaven, located outside of New York City. I am an amateur musician, a Lindy
Hopper, and an enthusiastic Baltimoron.
