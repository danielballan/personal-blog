The Gaurdian posted a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/lv?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdHJ2TjFrNTNEVURFWkxtdHl6bm50YlE) with athlete age, height, weight, gender, and some structured biographical information.

It reminds me of a photoshoot displaying the variety of ideal body types among these paragons. The photos are around the Internet, titled "The Athlete" by Howard Schartz and Beverly Ornstein. Try, for example, [this blog](http://ninamatsumoto.wordpress.com/2010/12/18/athletic-body-diversity-reference-for-artists/) or the numbered links at the bottom of [this page](http://www.udel.edu/anthro/neitzel/supplemental%20sportsS09.htm).
