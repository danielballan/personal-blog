[Justin Fenton](https://twitter.com/justin_fenton), The Baltimore Sun's crime reporter (succeeding David Simon, the creator of _The Wire_), linked to this heat map of the Baltimore city vacants. It was created by [Elliot Plack](https://twitter.com/TalllGuy) using a tool called [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/) that looks really powerful.

Incidentally, the location where _The Wire_ filmed [Hamsterdam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamsterdam) isn't here. The _AV Club_ Pop Pilgrims went looking for it and [found it had been razed](http://www.avclub.com/articles/baltimore-the-wire-locations-part-one,57344/).
