I finished _No. 44, The Mysterious Stranger_, Mark Twain's last novel. The plot, such as it is, is ultimately consumed by bizarre and fragmented events, tumbling into an existential thesis (which I will not spoil). As the absurdity escalates, a character invokes poetry as a spell to reverse a time, incanting,

> Backward, turn backward, O Time, in thy flight—Make me a child again, just for to-night

In fact, the incantation only rewinds clocks by several hours; nobody is restored to childhood, nor are they meant to be. Maybe there was more on the author's mind. I found the poem in full, by Elizabeth Akers Allen in 1860. It is a sentimental death wish. Allen also wrote a response, entitled "Answer To Rock Me To Sleep." It assures the supplicant, "Angels, my darling, will rock thee to sleep." I doubt Twain was satisfied.

Here is the poem in full.
> Backward, turn backward, O time, in your flight,
Make me a child again just for tonight
Mother, come back from the echoless shore,
Take me again to your heart as of yore;

> Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care
Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair;
Over my slumbers your loving watch keep;
Rock me to sleep, Mother, rock me to sleep!

> Backward, flow backward, oh, tide of the years
I am so weary of toil and of tears;
Toil without recompense, tears all in vain— 
Take them, and give me my childhood again!

> I have grown weary of dust and decay— 
Weary of flinging my soul-wealth away,
Weary of sowing for others to reap;
Rock me to sleep, Mother, rock me to sleep!

> Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue,
Mother, O Mother, my heart calls for you!
Many a summer the grass has grown green,
Blossomed and faded, our faces between.

> Yet, with strong yearning and passionate pain,
Long I tonight for your presence again.
Come from the silence so long and so deep;
Rock me to sleep, Mother, rock me to sleep!

> Over my heart, in the days that are flown,
No love like mother-love ever has shone;
No other worship abides and endures—
Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours:

> None like a mother can charm away pain
From the sick soul and the world-weary brain.
Slumber's soft calms over my heavy lids creep;
Rock me to sleep, Mother, rock me to sleep!

> Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold,
Fall on your shoulders again as of old;
Let it drop over my forehead tonight,
Shading my faint eyes away from the light;

> For with it's sunny-edged shadows once more
Haply will throng the sweet vision of yore;
Lovingly, softly, it's bright billows sweep:
Rock me to sleep, Mother, rock me to sleep!

> Mother, dear Mother, the years been long
Since I last listened to your lullaby song.
Sing, then, and unto my soul it shall seem
Womanhood's years have been only a dream.

> Clasped to your heart in a loving embrace,
With your light lashes just sweeping my face,
Never hereafter to wake or to weep;
Rock me to sleep, Mother, rock me to sleep!
