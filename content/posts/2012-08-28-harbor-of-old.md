[![Baltimore in 1912]({% asset_path inner-harbor-1912-700px.jpg %})]({% asset_path inner-harbor-1912.jpg %})

Click to pull up a giant version of this artwork. It is beautifully detailed, down to little street lamps and curls of smoke. [_City That Breeds_ juxtaposed it](http://citythatbreeds.com/2011/04/hey-look-a-big-giant-100-year-old-map-of-the-inner-harbor/) with a satellite photograph from Google Earth.

This view of the inner harbor in 1911 led me to a whole page of [historical paintings and photographs](http://www.kilduffs.com/Harbor.html) of the city, including this one depicting Fells Point across the harbor before it was developed.
