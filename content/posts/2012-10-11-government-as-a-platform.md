Tim O'Reilly, a tech publisher and advocate of smart government, posted slides from a presentation on the role of government as a platform. Government, like the Internet or the iPhone, can provide a basic, open-ended framework, on which people can build anything they can imagine. Open data, open source software, and initiatives like Code for America (read: Teach for America for programmers) are giving citizens direct access to the tools of government. And encouraging things are happening.
