Skim this guide to the issues on the Maryland ballot, compiled from a night of drinking and arguing with Jim Murray, Justin Rogers, Maya Buchanan, Kelly Stallard, Steph Rabe, and Nik Hartman, who conceived this scheme. Scroll through our slides over a drink tonight to get up to speed the fun way.

Update: Just to be clear, some of these slides are opinionated because that was the point. Everyone at this party had similar politics, so we split up the task of researching which way to vote. A handful of the issues were debatable among our group, and those were explained a little more seriously.

Here is the [official ballot](http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/2012/general_ballot_proofs/03.pdf).
