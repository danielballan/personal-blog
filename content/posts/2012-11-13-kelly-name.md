I downloaded Social Security Administration's [record of baby names](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html). Here is what I learned about the name Kelly. I followed an example in [this book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do) on a handy set of tools for studying messy, real-life data called [_pandas_](http://pandas.pydata.org/).
