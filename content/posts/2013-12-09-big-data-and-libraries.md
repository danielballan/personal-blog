In October, Johns Hopkins launched an institude for big data, dubbed [idies](http://idies.jhu.edu/). At a kick-off event, a roster of administrators and faculty offered quick lecutres. I learned that JHU has an "Asocciate Dean for Research Data Management," affiliated with the university library. As the traditional role of libraries is displaced, he sees a new job: storing and managing data generated by research.

'Tis the season to launch big data initiatives. A few days later, my alma mater [launched an Institute for Data Science](http://www.rochester.edu/rocdata/). In November, Fernando Perez, a leader in the scientific Python community [announced a related initiative at Berkeley](http://blog.fperez.org/2013/11/an-ambitious-experiment-in-data-science.html).
