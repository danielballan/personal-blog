Pore over [this report](http://www.free2work.org/trends/apparel/Apparel-Industry-Trends-2012.pdf) on the extent to which apparel companies prevent and address modern slavery through their supply chain.

Of the mainstrain companies, Hanes and Timberland come out well. Express, Aeropostale, Fruit of the Loom, and of course Walmart are among the losers.

This summarizing chart is on Page 4 of the report. If it disappears from Internet, here's a [local copy]({% asset_path Apparel-Industry-Trends-2012.pdf %}).
