When I need to fit a function to some data, Python is a cumbersome choice. I'm not sure I could win a race against someone working in Igor or even Excel.

pyMC has received a lot of attention, but for traditional LM least-squared fitting, most users use scipy, which lacks some amenities. I need a tool that provides succinct syntax for straightforward tasks, handles data with missing values (a la pandas), and returns results in a form that I can easily plot.

Matt Newville's [lmfit](https://github.com/newville/lmfit-py/) project is a big step forward from scipy. Like many graphical data analysis programs, it can set bounds on individual fit parameters or hold them fixed.

Inspired by some ideas by @vnmanoharan in [this discussion](https://github.com/newville/lmfit-py/issues/56), I wrote a fresh interface to lmfit that addresses all the needs listed above. It has been merged into the development version of lmfit. A demo of the key features follows.
