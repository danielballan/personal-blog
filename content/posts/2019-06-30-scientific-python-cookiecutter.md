title: Bootstrap a Scientific Python Library
date: 2019-06-30

At the SciPy conference last year, several talks pointed to the need for better
resources to help scientists and students get oriented with all the tools
*around* scientific Python&mdash;tools for version control, testing, and
documentation that are essential for supporting collaboration and maintenance.
A basic familiarity with these tools enables someone to create an open-source
scientific Python project that invites collaboration and reuse, and it enables
them to contribute to an existing project.

I gave a lightning talk on a project I started to help scientists and students
get started with the essentials: organizing code in modules, adding tests and
running them using pytest, writing numpydoc docstrings and narrative examples,
publishing HTML documentation using sphinx, setting up a continuous integration
service, and publishing releases. The project includes a template
("cookiecutter") and, more importantly, documentation on the most essential
aspects of each tool.

The project is documented at
[nsls-ii.github.io/scientific-python-cookiecutter/](https://nsls-ii.github.io/scientific-python-cookiecutter/).

I hope that this project lowers the barrier to entry to contributing to the
scientific Python ecosystem.
