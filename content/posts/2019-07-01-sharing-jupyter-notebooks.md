"Who is my audience?" is a good question to begin with. We could refine that to,
"How far will this code go? How many people will use it? And for how long will
they rely on it to work?" 

For example, if you are the only user and you only need the code for a day, you
might use a a Jupyter notebook as a messy scratch pad, executing cells out of
order and not bothering to leave a record of the software dependencies (what
libraries, what versions, etc.).  But if the notebook is meant to be used for a
long time by many people, you might clean up the code a bit, ensure the cells
execute top-to-button,
[move any large code chunks out of the notebook and into traditional Python modules](https://nsls-ii.github.io/scientific-python-cookiecutter/),
put the notebook in version control using
[nbdime](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
and specify the software-dependencies in a
[Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)-compatible repository.
The appropriate level of effort and ceremony depends on how far the code will go.
We can vizualize the space of how "far" code goes in space (people) and in time.

[A recent talk on this question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcJeHNWOoWk)
asked the audience to answer for themselves where in this space they impose
version control, an issue tracker like GitHub, tests, continuous
integration, a README, API documentation, usage examples, and so on. Where in
this space does the benefit justify the effort?

Considering sharing Jupyter notebooks in particular, we could further ask, how
much effort does the *sender* invest to share it and how much effort does the
*recipient* invest to get that notebook working for them?

![current tools placed in the space of sender and recipient effort](/static/images/effort-status-quo.svg)

The most obvious way for beginners to send and receive notebooks is to
email them. Consider where that fits in this space. If the recipient happens to
have all the right libraries and other resources already available, this might
*just workâ„¢*. But more often the recipient needs to sort out the right
environment to run the notebook in. In this sense, sharing notebooks on
[nbviewer](nbviewer.org) fits in about the same space&mdash; one gets a better
user experience in exchange for learning about nbviewer, but the notebook does
not encode anything about the environment it should be run in. To provide the
recipient with this information, the sender can provide a
[Reproducible Execution Environment Specification](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specification.html) (REES),
which may be as simple as a ``requirements.txt`` file or as custom as a
``Dockerfile``. It is a significant step up in effort or expertise required from
the sender.

What new tools can we imagine filling this space? Some quetsions to consider:

* Are the sender and recipient on the same JupyterHub?
* Is the notebook being "published" for long-term reuse by many people (the
  nbviewer use case) or quickly transferred between a small number of people
  for short-term collaboration (the email use case)?
* Is the unit being shared one notebook or a set of notebooks and associated
  data files?
* Does the notebook have specific or specialized resource requirements?

For low-effort sharing between two users on the same JupyterHub, I propose
[JupyterHub Share Link](https://github.com/danielballan/jupyterhub-share-link),
which provides functionality similar to Google Docs' feature:
"Anyone with link can read" (and make a copy). By assuming that the users are
on the same Hub and that the sharing is short-term, the tool can automatically
open the recipient's notebook in the right environment. See link for details.

For sharing that is longer-term or between users are not logged into the same
Hub, we need a more explicit list of requirements from the sender. How can move
that to the left on our diagram? We can look for ways for make it easier for the
sender to define a REES by adding a UI and other tooling.

As an aside, it is tempting to aim for a tool that can detect all the software
dependencies automatically with no effort by the sender. My personal view is
that fully automating this is not worthwhile because the result will always be
brittle. Maybe a tool that can that can provide a *guess* as a starting point to
be reviewed and refined by the sender could be viable.

Placed on the space of sender and recipient effort, these new ideas might fall
roughly like:

We can also make the tools behind Binder directly applicable in more contexts.
For example, we could imagine:

* a JupyterHub Service that builds a container from a REES without requiring Kubernetes
* an alternate builder that builds a conda environment instead of a container,
  for the subset of REES where this is possible (i.e. no ``Dockerfile`` support
  of course)
* a gallery of REES containers published by other users with options to spawn
  in a container that mounts the recipient's local storage to provide
  persistence

These ideas grew out of conversations at the
[Jupyter Community Workshop for Scientific User Facilities and HPC](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-community-workshop-jupyter-for-scientific-user-facilities-and-high-performance-computing-3afa4a990086). Some of us plan to prototype them in the repository
[danielballan/jupyter-rees-service](https://github.com/danielballan/jupyter-rees-service).

What regions in the space of sender and recipient effort and code lifecycle are
important?
