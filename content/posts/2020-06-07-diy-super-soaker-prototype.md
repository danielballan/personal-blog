The Super Soakers from the 1990s with engineered with clever, patented ideas
advancing toy water gun technology. Since the early 200s, toy manufacturers have
abandoned these ideas and regressed to selling cheaper, simpler models that take
up less shelf space and hit a lower price point. Nowadays, if you want a Super
Soaker that holds up to the ones from the 90s, you have to find an old model in
the used toy market or build your own. This what I have learned in building my
first homemade Super Soaker.

## Super Soakers Had Some Innovative Ideas

The Super Soaker was invented in 1982 by
[Lonnie Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonnie_Johnson_(inventor)), while
he was employed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab. It was ready for commercialization
in 1990, first marketed as the "Power Drencher". Dozens of variations on this
design would follow.

Photos of Johnson's prototypes and an "evolution tree" of the many Super Soaker
models are documented in this
[lovingly-detailed history](http://www.isoaker.com/Info/history_supersoaker.html).
A fandom Wiki enumerates the
[Classic](https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/Classic_Super_Soaker) (1991--1998),
[XP](https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/XP) (1994--2001), and
[CPS](https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/CPS) (1996--2002) models.

US Patent [US5150819A, "Double tank pinch trigger pump water gun"](https://patents.google.com/patent/US5150819A/en),
describes the innovations behind the Classic and XP models. I would
summarize them like this:

* Pumping the Super Soaker does not discharge it. Pressure can be stored---by
  means of two one-way valves---and then released via a separate trigger.
* The pumping action *pumps water* or a mixture of water and air. This does more
  work per stroke than pumping air alone would do.
* The early Classic models have only one chamber, the water reservoir, which is
  pressurized by pumping. Later Classic and XP models have a *separate charmber*
  for storing the pressurized air and water. The water resevoir is now
  unpressurized and can be refilled during pumping or firing. Because the reservoir does
  not need to be sealed, it can be a bottle with an open hole for refilling or even
  [a swimming pool](https://nerfpedialegacy.fandom.com/wiki/XP_Pool_Pumper_Blaster).
* Finally, there is a safety trigger. To escape through the nozzle, the
  pressurized water and air must flow through a flexible tube. The tube is
  normally pinched shut by a spring. The pinched tube blocks the exit. Pressing
  the trigger overcomes the force the spring, allows the flexible tube to be
  un-pinched, and lets pressurized water spray out of the gun. This acts as a
  safety mechanism to ensure the Super Soaker cannot be overpressurized: at a
  certain maximum pressure (calibrated by the strength of that spring) the tube
  will open regardless of whether the trigger is pressed.

The patent is credited to Johnson and Bruce M. D'Andrade, who helped develop
Johnson's homemade prototype into a design viable for commercial manufacture.
A later patent, [US6193107B1, "Bladder water gun"](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6193107B1/en),
credited solely to D'Andrade, describes the design underlying the CPS (Constant
Pressure System) series.

![US5150819A Figure 2](/static/images/US5150819A-Fig2.png)

In a CPS model, the pumping action forces water into an elastic balloon that
delivers a steady blast of water when discharged. This has some advantage over
the XPs, which slow to a trickle when the pressure drops; however, it requires a
lot more pumping for a comparatively short blast. CPS models also tend to be
larger and heavier. The history linked above reports rumors that the CPS 2000
was removed from the market for being overpowered.

## The D.I.Y. Community

In the D.I.Y. community, high-powered CPS models---often with a militarized
aesthetic---are a popular project. I am much more interested in Johnson's
original air-pressurized design. It's more adaptable, lighter-weight, and more
fun. Fortunately, there are some excellent resources on these as well. D.I.Y.
implementations of Johnson's deign go by the term "Air-Pressure Homemade" online. I followed
[a detailed guide for building one out of PVC](http://www.sscentral.org/homemade/aph/),
which was developed by
[Ben Trettel](http://trettel.org/) about a decade ago. Appropriately enough,
Trettel is currently a PhD student studying turbulent liquid jet breakup.
His homemade Super Soakers have been
[featured by the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/magazine/who-made-that-super-soaker.html).

Many of the links here, including that guide, are archives that haven't been
substantially updated since the early 2010s. I found more recent activity in the
formus at [WaterWar.net](https://waterwar.net/forum/index.php), where discussion
consists of sharing photos of D.I.Y. builds, floating design ideas for
feedback, and griping about the sorry state of commercially-avialable Super
Soakers these days.

## My Prototype

My prototype follows [Trettel's guide](http://www.sscentral.org/homemade/aph/)
with the following variations:

* The guide uses a mixture of 1/2" and 3/4" PVC. I used 3/4" throughout.
* I used (mostly) pressure-rated Schedule 40 PVC. Any old PVC *should* be fine
  at toy-water-gun pressures, but Trettel has commented subsequently that the
  guide ought to recommend pressure-rated PVC, and I agree. 3/4" Schedule 40 is
  rated up to hundreds of psi with a bursting pressure of ~1500 psi. For
  content, garden hose pressure is 40--70 psi, and water gun pressures are
  reported to be around 40.
* The pressure chambers and the water resevoir connection are threaded on, not
  solvent-welded on, so I can swap out alternatives in the future. The nozzle is
  also threaded, as it is in Trettel's design.

## Next Steps

* My nozzle is a sloppily-drilled 1/4" hole in PVC. A neater hole will give a
  more coherent stream, and a smaller hole will give a longer range.
  the stream, and a smaller hole would increase the range.
