The Super Soakers from the 1990s were engineered with clever, patented ideas
advancing toy water gun technology. Since the early 2000s, toy manufacturers
have abandoned these ideas and regressed to selling cheaper, simpler models that
take up less shelf space and hit a lower price point. Nowadays, if you want a
Super Soaker that holds up to the ones from the 90s, you have to find an old
model in the used toy market or build your own. This what I have learned in
building my first homemade Super Soaker.

## Super Soakers had some innovative ideas

The Super Soaker was invented in 1982 by
[Lonnie Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonnie_Johnson_(inventor)), while
he was employed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab. It was ready for commercialization
in 1990, first marketed as the "Power Drencher". Dozens of variations on this
design would follow.

Photos of Johnson's prototypes and an "evolutionary tree" of the many Super
Soaker models are documented in this
[lovingly-detailed history](http://www.isoaker.com/Info/history_supersoaker.html).
A fandom Wiki enumerates the
[Classic](https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/Classic_Super_Soaker) (1991--1998),
[XP](https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/XP) (1994--2001), and
[CPS](https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/CPS) (1996--2002) models.

US Patent [US5150819A, "Double tank pinch trigger pump water gun"](https://patents.google.com/patent/US5150819A/en),
describes the innovations behind the Classic and XP models. In summary:

* Pumping the Super Soaker does not discharge it. Pressure can be stored---by
  means of two one-way valves---and then released via a separate trigger.
* The early Classic models have only one chamber, the water reservoir, which is
  pressurized by pumping air. Later Classic and XP models have a *separate charmber*
  for storing the pressurized air and water. This has several advantages:
  * The water resevoir is now unpressurized and can be refilled during pumping
    or firing.
  * Because the reservoir does not need to be sealed, it can be a bottle with an
    open hole for refilling or even
    [a swimming pool](https://nerfpedialegacy.fandom.com/wiki/XP_Pool_Pumper_Blaster).
  * The pumping action pumps water or a mixture of water and air. This does more
    work per stroke than pumping air alone would do because water is
    incompressible.
* Finally, there is a safety trigger. To escape through the nozzle, the
  pressurized water and air must flow through a flexible tube. The tube is
  normally pinched shut by a spring. The pinched tube blocks the exit. Pressing
  the trigger overcomes the force the spring, allows the flexible tube to be
  un-pinched, and lets pressurized water spray out of the gun. This acts as a
  safety mechanism to ensure the Super Soaker cannot be overpressurized: at a
  certain maximum pressure (calibrated by the strength of that spring) the tube
  will open regardless of whether the trigger is pressed.

The patent is credited to Johnson and Bruce M. D'Andrade, who helped develop
Johnson's prototype into a design viable for commercial manufacture.
A later patent, [US6193107B1, "Bladder water gun"](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6193107B1/en),
credited solely to D'Andrade, describes the design underlying the CPS (Constant
Pressure System) series. In a CPS model, the pumping action forces water into an
elastic balloon that delivers a steady blast of water when discharged. This has
some advantage over the XPs, which slow to a trickle when the pressure drops;
however, it requires a lot more pumping for a comparatively short blast. CPS
models also tend to be larger and heavier. The history linked above reports
rumors that the CPS 2000 was removed from the market for being overpowered.

## There are good D.I.Y. Super Soaker resources

In the D.I.Y. community, high-powered CPS models are popular. I am much more
interested in Johnson's original air-pressurized design. It's more adaptable,
lighter-weight, and more fun. Fortunately, there are some excellent resources on
these as well. D.I.Y. implementations of Johnson's design go by the term
"Air-Pressure Homemade". I followed
[a detailed guide for building one out of PVC](http://www.sscentral.org/homemade/aph/),
which was developed by
[Ben Trettel](http://trettel.org/) about a decade ago. (It made me smile to
discover than Trettel is currently a PhD student studying turbulent liquid jet
breakup.)

Most of the D.I.Y. resources I found, including that guide, are archives that
haven't been substantially updated since the early 2010s. I found more recent
activity in the formus at [WaterWar.net](https://waterwar.net/forum/index.php),
where discussion consists of sharing photos of D.I.Y. builds, floating design
ideas for feedback, and griping about the sorry state of commercially-available
Super Soakers these days.

In 2017, D.I.Y. YouTube personality Mark Rober made splash with a
[record-holding Super Soaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1KRQ3RcvXA). His
video describing the project includes an interview with Johnson.

## My prototype is a variation on a popular guide

{{< youtube lI2h-UshqYA >}}

My prototype follows [Trettel's guide](http://www.sscentral.org/homemade/aph/)
with the following minor variations:

* The pressure chambers and the water reservoir connection are threaded on, not
  solvent-welded on, so I can swap out alternatives. (The nozzle is also
  threaded.)
* The guide uses a mixture 1/2" and 3/4" PVC. I used 3/4" throughout.
* The guide uses 3" PVC for the pressure chambers. 3" PVC was not readily
  available, so I made chambers of 2" PVC with equal volume. As a result, they
  are quite tall.
* I used mostly pressure-rated Schedule 40 PVC. Any PVC *should* be fine
  at toy-water-gun pressures, but Trettel has commented subsequently that the
  guide should have recommend pressure-rated PVC to be safe, and I agree. 3/4"
  Schedule 40 is rated up to hundreds of psi with a bursting pressure of ~1500
  psi. For context, garden hose pressure is 40--70 psi, and water gun pressures
  are reported to be around 40 psi.

## Next Steps

* My first nozzle is a sloppily-drilled 1/4" hole in PVC. A neater and smaller
  hole will give a more coherent stream and longer range. My prototypes has a
  range of about 30 feet; folks online consistently report 55--60 feet for this
  kind of build.
* I need a portable water reservoir---maybe a variety of them with different
  sizes.
* Handle-bar tape (for bicycles) can be used to make more comfortable grips.
* This was my first time solvent-welding PVC. The construction feels solid and
  has so far not leaked, but I could make more secure connections given a second
  chance. I plan to discard this as a learning experience and start from
  scratch. I will use exclusively Schedule 40 (pressure-rated) pipe and
  fixtures.
* I'd like to apply paint in the classic Super Soaker color schemes.
